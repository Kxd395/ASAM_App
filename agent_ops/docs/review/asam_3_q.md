### Guide to Creating Each Question in the ASAM Criteria Assessment Interview Guide Forms

The document "asam-paper-criteria---edtitable-final-form (1).pdf" is a comprehensive interview guide for conducting a multidimensional assessment based on The ASAM Criteria for adults. It is structured around six dimensions, with additional sections for summary, withdrawal management, level of care determination, and appendices. The forms are designed as interactive assessment tools, including questions, tables, scales, checkboxes, and interviewer notes. This guide details how to create each question or form element, based solely on the content of this document. I'll break it down by section/dimension, explaining:

- **Question/Element Text**: The exact wording from the document.
- **Response Type**: How responses are captured (e.g., open-ended text, yes/no checkboxes, scales, tables, multiple choice).
- **Associated Probes/Prompts**: Any follow-up questions or instructions to elicit more detail.
- **Interviewer Notes/Instructions**: Guidance for the interviewer, including motivational interviewing (MI) tips, safety considerations, or cross-references to ASAM Criteria (3rd ed.).
- **How to Create/Format**: Practical advice for implementing in a form (e.g., paper, digital like Google Forms, PDF editable, or app-based). Include layout suggestions for usability, such as indentation for sub-questions or color-coding scales.
- **Rationale/Context**: Why the question exists (based on document context), to ensure thorough recreation.

This covers **only the forms and questions** from the document—introductory notes, severity ratings, problem/goal sections, and appendices are included where they involve form-like elements. Non-question elements (e.g., pure explanatory text) are omitted. The document emphasizes using MI skills, assuming good intent, and prioritizing safety (e.g., immediate referrals for emergent needs).

#### Preliminary/Introductory Questions (Before Dimension 1)
These set the stage for the assessment.

1. **Question/Element Text**: "Before we get started, can you tell me about why you have come to meet with me today? Probe: How can I be of help? What are you seeking treatment for?"
   - **Response Type**: Open-ended text field.
   - **Associated Probes/Prompts**: The probes are built-in ("How can I be of help? What are you seeking treatment for?").
   - **Interviewer Notes/Instructions**: If emergent physical/mental health needs are identified, consider ED referral or 911. If intoxicated/in withdrawal, delay full assessment and refer for medical evaluation/withdrawal management.
   - **How to Create/Format**: Place at the top as a large text box for narrative response. In digital form, use a textarea with character limit (e.g., 500). Add a checkbox for interviewer to note if referral was made.
   - **Rationale/Context**: Establishes rapport and identifies immediate needs; supersedes other instructions if safety is at risk.

#### Dimension 1: Acute Intoxication or Withdrawal Potential (Pages 1-4)
This section uses tables for substance history and scales for self-reports.

1. **Question/Element Text**: "I am going to read you a list of substances. Could you tell me which ones you have used, how long, how recently, and how you used them?" (Continued across pages for multiple substances).
   - **Response Type**: Table with columns: Substance (pre-listed, e.g., Alcohol, Heroin/Fentanyl/Other Non-Prescription Opioids, etc.), Duration (Years/Months estimate), Frequency in last 30 days (4-7 days/week, 1-3 days/week, 3 or less days/month, Not used, Never Used), Route (checkboxes: Oral, Nasal/snort, Smoke, Inject, Other [rectal, patches, etc.]). Additional fields per substance: Date of last use, Avg. drinks per day (for alcohol), Valid prescription? (yes/no for prescription misuse).
   - **Associated Probes/Prompts**: For alcohol: "In the last 30 days, how often have you had [females: 4+ drinks; males: 5+ drinks] on one occasion?" For "Other Drugs": List each separately (up to 3).
   - **Interviewer Notes/Instructions**: Binge drinking increases withdrawal risk; misuse includes refilling too often or off-label use (check PDMP); specific risks for opioids (7-10 days continuous use), benzodiazepines (6 months daily), etc. Use MI to explore risky use.
   - **How to Create/Format**: Build as a repeatable table row for each substance (pre-populate common ones, add rows for "Other"). Use dropdowns for frequency, multi-select checkboxes for route. In PDF/digital, make expandable. Color-code "Never Used" as grayed-out.
   - **Rationale/Context**: Assesses withdrawal potential by substance; table format allows systematic tracking of patterns indicating tolerance/risk.
