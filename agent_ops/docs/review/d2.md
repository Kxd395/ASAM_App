Perfect. Here is the updated document in the exact style you used, with your verbatim Dimension 2 wording preserved and the user friendly quick response features added right under each item. I kept the [cite_start] tags and your citation numbers intact. All UI text I added is clearly marked as “UI Enhancements” so there is zero risk of mixing guidance with source wording.

## Implementation tips

* Keep exact labels and numbers locked and versioned as v3-D2.
* Store quick chips server side so you can update without redeploy.
* Autosave each interaction and stamp completion time for items 6 and 19.
* Provide a one-tap read-back summary for handoff.

If you want the next step, I can generate either a JSON schema or a React component scaffold that encodes this spec and all conditional logic exactly. Just say which format you prefer.
